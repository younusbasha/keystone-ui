## Core Workflow Definitions

### 1. Add Project → Add Requirements → Agent Breakdown → Review → Deploy

#### Phase 1: Project Creation
**Trigger**: PM creates new project
**Process**:
1. PM defines project scope, objectives, and constraints
2. System creates project workspace and assigns unique ID
3. PM selects and assigns relevant agents to project
4. Initial project dashboard and metrics tracking activated

**Success Criteria**: Project created with proper agent assignments and tracking enabled

#### Phase 2: Requirements Input
**Trigger**: BA or PM adds business requirement
**Process**:
1. User inputs natural language requirement description
2. Requirements Parser Agent analyzes text using NLP
3. System extracts entities, intent, and business context
4. Agent generates confidence score and preliminary breakdown
5. User reviews and approves/modifies parsed requirements

**Success Criteria**: Requirement successfully parsed with >80% confidence score

#### Phase 3: Agent Breakdown
**Trigger**: Approved requirement enters processing pipeline
**Process**:
1. **Task Planner Agent** creates epic and story structure
2. **Story Generator Agent** develops detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
3. **Task Breakdown Agent** creates specific, actionable tasks
4. **Estimation Agent** provides effort estimates and dependencies
5. **Code Generator Agent** (if applicable) creates initial code scaffolding
6. All outputs reviewed for consistency and completeness

**Success Criteria**: Complete task hierarchy with estimates and dependencies

#### Phase 4: Review & Approval
**Trigger**: Agent breakdown completed
**Process**:
1. System flags items requiring human review based on risk assessment
2. Reviewer examines agent outputs for quality and accuracy
3. Technical tasks routed to Developer for validation
4. Business logic reviewed by BA for alignment with requirements
5. PM approves overall structure and resource allocation
6. Any rejected items returned to agents for refinement

**Success Criteria**: All high-risk items approved, quality standards met

#### Phase 5: Deployment
**Trigger**: All tasks approved and ready for implementation
**Process**:
1. **Deployment Orchestrator Agent** creates CI/CD pipeline
2. **Code Generator Agents** produce implementation code
3. **Testing Agents** create and execute test suites
4. **Security Review Agent** performs vulnerability assessment
5. **Deployment Agent** manages staging and production releases
6. **Monitoring Agent** tracks post-deployment metrics

**Success Criteria**: Successful deployment with monitoring active

## Agent Logic and Handoffs

### Agent Coordination Rules

#### 1. Sequential Processing
- Requirements Parser → Task Planner → Story Generator → Code Generator
- Each agent waits for predecessor completion before starting
- Handoff includes full context and confidence scores

#### 2. Parallel Processing (where applicable)
- Code Generator and Test Generator can work simultaneously
- Documentation Agent runs parallel to implementation
- Monitoring setup occurs parallel to deployment

#### 3. Escalation Triggers
**Automatic Escalation**:
- Agent confidence score <70%
- Processing time exceeds 2x estimated duration
- Conflicting outputs from multiple agents
- Security or compliance flags raised

**Human Review Required**:
- Production database modifications
- External API integrations
- User-facing feature changes
- Budget impact >$1000 equivalent

### Agent Communication Protocol

#### 1. Context Sharing
```json
{
  "handoffId": "unique_identifier",
  "fromAgent": "requirements-parser",
  "toAgent": "task-planner",
  "context": {
    "originalRequirement": "text",
    "parsedEntities": {},
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "businessContext": {},
    "constraints": []
  },
  "timestamp": "ISO_8601",
  "priority": "high|medium|low"
}
```

#### 2. Conflict Resolution
**Priority-Based**: Higher priority agents override lower priority
**Consensus-Based**: Multiple agents vote on conflicting decisions
**Human Arbitration**: Complex conflicts escalated to appropriate human reviewer

#### 3. Quality Gates
Each agent handoff includes quality validation:
- Output completeness check
- Consistency with previous stages
- Adherence to project constraints
- Risk assessment and flagging

## System Behavior Rules

### 1. Auto-Approval Thresholds
- **Low Risk + High Confidence (>90%)**: Auto-approved
- **Medium Risk + High Confidence (>95%)**: Auto-approved with notification
- **High Risk**: Always requires human review
- **Critical Risk**: Requires PM approval

### 2. Retry Logic
- Failed agent actions retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- Persistent failures escalated to human review
- System maintains failure logs for pattern analysis

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Agent response times tracked and alerted if >2x baseline
- Success rates monitored with alerts for <85% success
- Resource utilization capped at 80% to maintain responsiveness

### 4. Data Consistency
- All agent actions logged with full audit trail
- State changes atomic and reversible
- Concurrent access managed with optimistic locking

## Integration Points

### 1. External Systems
- **GitHub**: Code repository management and version control
- **Jira**: Task tracking and project management sync
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Slack**: Notifications and team communication

### 2. API Boundaries
- All agent communications via internal API
- External integrations through dedicated adapter services
- Rate limiting and authentication on all endpoints

### 3. Data Flow
```
User Input → Requirements API → Agent Queue → Processing Pipeline → Review Queue → Approval API → Implementation Queue → Deployment Pipeline → Monitoring
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### 1. Agent Failures
- Graceful degradation to human-assisted mode
- Automatic retry with different agent instance
- Fallback to previous known good state

### 2. System Failures
- Circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
- Graceful degradation of non-critical features
- Automatic failover to backup systems

### 3. Data Recovery
- Point-in-time recovery for all critical data
- Audit trail preservation during system issues
- Automated backup verification and testing
