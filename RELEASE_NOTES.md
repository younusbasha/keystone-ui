3. **Test authentication flows** with the enhanced role-based access control
4. **Verify API integrations** with new endpoint configurations

#### Code Updates Required
```typescript
// Before
const { projects, isLoading } = useData();

// After (expanded functionality)
const { 
  projects, 
  tasks, 
  agents, 
  dashboardStats, 
  isLoading,
  loadTasks,
  loadAgents,
  loadDashboardStats 
} = useData();
```
